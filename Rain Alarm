Rain Alarm Project is a simple but very useful project that detects Rain (Rain Water) and automatically triggers an alarm or buzzer.
Water is a basic need in every oneâ€™s life. Saving water and proper usage of water is very important. Here is an easy project which will give the alarm when there is rain, so that we can make some actions for rain water harvesting and also save the rain water for using it later. 
With the help of saving this rain water through rain water harvesting, we can increase the levels of underground water by using underwater recharge technique.
Rain water detector will detect the rain and make an alert; rain water detector is used in the irrigation field, home automation, communication, automobiles etc.


Rain Alarm Project Circuit Applications:
In the irrigation, it will detect the rain and immediately alert the farmer.
In automobiles, when the rain detector detects the rain it will immediately active the wipers and inform the driver.
In communications, it will boost the power of the antenna and increase the signal strength to send or receive the signals.
In normal house hold, with the help of rain water detector we can automatically save the rain water. (This can be done only when home automation is done and there is proper equipment to save the rain water. In this, rain water detector will detect the rain and helps to switch ON the equipment which will automatically save rain water for different purposes).
This can also be used if there is a chemical rain also. This is very common in industrial areas.
